			<p id="with-element">Westchester County is known for its close proximity to New York City which is ideal for citizens who commute to its metropolitan area daily either by car or through public transportation. </p>
		</section>
		<section>
			
			<p>With over 1 million residents residing in Westchester County today, the county is a direct access point to the New York City Metropolitan area through numerous sources. The county has a series of parkways that merge to major interstate highways such as I-95 and I-87, which lead directly into midtown Manhattan.</p>
			<p>The Metro-North railway is a series of train routes that run directly through Westchester along with neighboring counties such as Dutchess and Putnam County as well as parts of the state of Connecticut. The Metro North Railway allows commuters to get to Grand Central Station from Westchester in relativley under an hour. Along with the Metro-North railway, the county's bus system known as the “Bee-Line” runs through each town of the county along with parts of the Bronx. Combined, the Metro-North and Bee-Line transit systems create one of the most complex, diverse, and  important  public transit systems in the entire country that are responsible to help commute workers into New York City.</p>
			<p>Job data from the 2000 and 2020 United States Census Bureau shows the necessity of the transportation system in Westchester County. </p>
			<p>With the 2020 United States Census Bureau releasing its newest data on both population and job occupations within the county, the number of transportation jobs has stayed similar compared to data from the 2000 Census. The number of jobs in the transportation sector has gone from 14,698 employees in the 2000 census, to 14,108 in the 2020 census, a 4% decrease.</p>

			<h3>The Importance to Upkeeping Transportation</h3>
			<p id="with-element">While the decrease in jobs may seem worrisome, there are several factors to take into consideration. Over the 20-year span, the COVID-19 pandemic has completely shifted the lifestyle of everyday Americans in a number of manners. For health reasons, many commuters decided they feared catching COVID-19 while on board a bus or train and opted to take their cars to work instead of using public transportation. At the peak of the pandemic, most commuters had the option to work from their home, which meant they had no need to use public transportation at all.</p>

			<p id="with-element">Even though the pandemic has all but ended, people are still not commuting as often as they were during the pre-pandemic era. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority <a href="https://new.mta.info/coronavirus/ridership">posts daily numbers</a> of how many citizens have used public transportation for a specific day. The numbers are then compared to pre-pandemic numbers. The percentages compared to pre-pandemic numbers as of December 2022 are as low as 61% of what numbers used to be for the Metro-North Railroad. </p>

			<iframe title="Metro North Railroad" aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-7iwtI" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7iwtI/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="510" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script>

			<p id="with-element">While there have been fewer commuters coming from Westchester county, the need for transportation workers is still necessary. Michelle, an information agent for the Westchester County Department of Transportation for over 20 years stated why it is important to continue to keep running public transit at full speed despite fewer commuters using it as often:</p>

			<p>“Public transportation in Westchester County is the backbone that keeps both Westchester and New York City running every single day. While you may not think a lot of people are using it as often, there are still thousands that depends on it every day to get to work whether in Westchester or in New York City.” </p>
			<p>Michelle also stated the people who need public transportation the most are the workers who have no other transportation option:</p>
			<p>“People who are on lower incomes that can’t afford a car in Westchester depend on public transportation more than you think…It's their only way to get to work and if we cut services to lower the access for people to get to work with lower incomes, then they might lose their job which helps nobody at the end of the day.”</p>
			<p>The trend of lower-income people needing to use public transportation more than others was a theme at the height of the pandemic as sectors of low-wage workers were considered essential. Yonah Freemark of the Urban Institute describes the dropoff in which higher-paid workers had more freedom of where they wanted to work during the pandemic as opposed to lower-wage workers: </p>
			<p>“Pandemic period travel trends indicate clearly that core riders—people with low incomes, people of color, and people with fewer years of education—used transit and will most likely continue. This data provides an opportunity for agencies to understand the travel demands and needs of riders who are most likely to continue using services—pandemic or not.”</p>
			<p>Freemark makes it clear that there is a significant disparity between classes when it comes to both work and means of transportation. It is essential to offer both the same amount of transportation services if there are not as many commuters since groups such as low-wage workers have no choice but to use public transit to commute.</p>

			<h3>Ensuring a Service for those who Need</h3>
			<p>As both Westchester and New York City transition out of the pandemic, the question of whether public transit commuters will ever reach pre-pandemic numbers again remains unanswered. While limiting the costs to a sector that is not getting as much use may seem like the right financial move, the need to keep a public service for workers who have no other option is necessary in order to allow commuters get to their jobs every day.</p>
