**HTML/CSS 1: Page Structure**  

Instructions: 

-- Download this repository and move the folder to your Desktop or JNL221 folder.

-- Locate a news story from a reputable online news source. It needs to have at least eight (8) paragraphs of written text and include at least two (2) high-resolution images with written photo captions.

-- Right-click on each image in the story and save it within the folder you just downloaded.

*It’s critical that all these files are within the same computer folder.*

Just like in class, I’d recommend that you open “main.html” in your browser as well as in Sublime Text so that you can examine your work as you go. If you don't know what an element is, check W3Schools or stackoverflow.com. Use previous repositories here [https://github.com/jnl221] as resources. We are at a point in the semester where you should feel comfortable researching how to do an unfamiliar thing. This assignment is as much a test of your research/Google skills as it is a test of your basic HTML skills!

 
**Inside the head element**

1. I’ve pre-written a CSS file (main.css) to style your HTML. Add a link element inside the head and set the rel attribute to “stylesheet” and the href attribute to “main.css”.

2. Also in the head, use the title element to give your page an appropriate title.

**Inside the body element:**  

3. Add an h3 element. Inside, write “HTML/CSS Assignment #1” followed by a break element. Next, write “Source: ” followed by the URL of the news story you’ve chosen. Make that URL into a working hyperlink to the original news story using an a tag.

4. Add a div element to hold the main image and caption for your story. Inside the div:

	a. Add an img element, setting the src attribute to the name of your first image file. Give it appropriate alt text. No need to add height or width.

	b. Add a paragraph element for the caption. Set its class element to “caption”. Use the appropriate HTML element to italicize the image credit in-line. (i.e. the name of the photographer or company source of the image from the written caption).

5. Add an h1 element that contains the story headline.

6. Add an h2 element that contains the story deck (usually an expansion of the headline with some more detail or a story summary in one or two sentences). If the story you chose doesn’t have a deck, write a brief one.

7. Add a paragraph element with the byline(s) of the reporters, and use the appropriate HTML element to make it bold in-line.

8. Add the first half of the story’s text content using the appropriate HTML element for each paragraph. Remember, the story you choose needs to contain a minimum of eight (8) written paragraphs. If the story has hyperlinks included in the story text, make sure that you add them to your version as well. 

9. Add a div for the second image and caption. Set its class attribute to “otherimg”. Follow the same instructions underneath step 4 to add an img and caption paragraph — just make sure the src attribute is for the second image file that you’ve saved.

10. Add the remaining paragraphs of the story using the appropriate HTML element for each paragraph.
